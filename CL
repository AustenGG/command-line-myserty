Reference: ./detective_handbook/step0.md

There's been a murder in Terminal City, and TCPD needs your help.

All the materials needed to figure out who did it are in the 'mystery' subdirectory. Using the commands from the Detective Handbook take a look around to see what files are in the 'mystery' subdirectory.

Once you answered the questions above, read the 'step1' file via your terminal to start collecting the clues.
ec2-user:~/environment/gitDir/clmystery (master) $ cat step1
Reference: ./detective_handbook/step1.md

Now it's time to collect the clues! The officers on the scene are pretty meticulous, so they've written down EVERYTHING in their officer reports. Take a look at the 'mystery/crimescene' file. It's quite large so use the `less` command to view the contents of the file, one screen at a time.


############ Challenge ###############

How can you view a file in different directory without switching to that directory first? What is the difference between absolute paths and relative paths?

######################################



You need to search for lines in the file marked with the word 'CLUE'. Use the `grep` command to do this.

Once you've found all the clues it's time to save them to a separate file for future reference.

Use `touch` to create a file named 'clues.txt'. Use `>` to save the output of the `grep` command to the 'clues.txt' file.

That's the first step done! Open 'step1-git' to see how you can track your work using a version control system (git).

CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.
